At the moment of this blog post I have over 97 games on steam. The problem though is that I have played a small fraction of these games <span class="bicon icon-emo-unhappy">&nbsp;</span>. Yes, it's sad. However, fear not as I have a plan to remedy this. 

For the foreseeable future I'll be playing through my list of games and posting about my experience with each as I go. That means this site not only will be recieving frequent updaes of content but I'll be able to go through my steam game list. Let's hope I don't keep accumulatting games faster than I can write posts.

If you want to check me out on steam, I can be found as [akosednar](http://steamcommunity.com/id/akosednar/). You can also hit me up on twitter at [@akosednar](http://twitter.com/akosednar/).
