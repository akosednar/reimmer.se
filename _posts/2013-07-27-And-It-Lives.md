The site lives! It has been a while since I've done anything on here (I blame school, work, some sort of social life..etc..). Regardless of the reason of its absence, it's finally back!

At the moment, I'm planning to go through my huge collection of games on steam and write or record about each as I go through them. I also hopefully will be writting some more technical posts as well as just stuff that interests me.

Anyways, we will see how it all goes!
