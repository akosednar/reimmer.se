Below is episode 2 from the Irregular Ramblings archives. Upon first inspection the title does not seem to match the episode, but I will fix that later.

> This was an episode recorded a couple months ago. I finally found time to cutting the audio files and getting it posted, though. So here is the episode! I hope you enjoy. I plan to add some more episodes later and increase my output of them.
